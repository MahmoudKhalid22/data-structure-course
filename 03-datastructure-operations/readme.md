## Different Types of Data Structure Operations with Examples

Data structure operations refer to the various actions that can be performed on a data structure. A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. Different data structures have different capabilities and efficiencies for different operations.

Data structure operations can be broadly categorized into two types:

1. Basic Operations: These are the fundamental operations that can be performed on a data structure. Examples include insertion, deletion, search, and access.

2. Advanced Operations: These are more complex operations that are built on top of basic operations. Examples include sorting, merging, splitting, and traversal.

Here is a list of common data structure operations with examples:

1. Insertion: Adding an element to the data structure. For example, inserting an element into an array or a linked list.

2. Deletion: Removing an element from the data structure. For example, removing an element from a array or a linked list.

3. Search: Finding an element in the data structure. For example, searching for a specific key or value in array or a linked list..

4. Access: Retrieving an element from the data structure. For example, accessing the first element of a queue.

5. Traversal: Visiting every element in the data structure. For example, printing all elements of an array or a linked list.

6. Sorting: Arranging elements in the data structure in a particular order. For example, sorting an array of integers in ascending or descending order.

7. Merging: Combining two data structures into one. For example, merging two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.

8. Splitting: Breaking a data structure into smaller parts. For example, splitting a linked list into two equal halves.

9. Reversal: Reversing the order of elements in the data structure. For example, reversing the elements of a stack.

10. Indexing: Accessing an element of the data structure using an index or a key. For example, accessing the element at index i in an array.
