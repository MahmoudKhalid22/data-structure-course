## What are some real-world applications of stacks?

Valid Parentheses:
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. The brackets must close in the correct order.
Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation:
Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation. Valid operators are +, -, \*, and /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
Next Greater Element:
Given an array, find the next greater element for each element in the array. The next greater element for an element x is the first greater element on its right side.
Min Stack:
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
Implement Queue using Stacks:
Implement a queue using two stacks.
Backspace String Compare:
Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.
Decode String:
Given an encoded string, return its decoded string. The encoding rule is k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is repeated exactly k times.
Largest Rectangle in Histogram:
Given an array of integers representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the area of the largest rectangle formed by the bars.
Validate Stack Sequences:
Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values, return true if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.
Binary Tree Inorder Traversal:
Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values using a stack.
These problems cover various aspects of stack data structures and their applications. They require problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and a good understanding of stack operations.
